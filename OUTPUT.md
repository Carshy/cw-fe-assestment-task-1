# Description of Changes made Summary

## Changes Made

### 🏗️ **Restructured Components for Better Organization**
- Split the monolithic `App.tsx` into focused, reusable components
- Created feature-based folders (`search/`, `tags/`, `common/`) for better code organization
- Each component now has a single responsibility, making them easier to test and maintain

### ♿ **Added Accessibility Support**
- Added proper ARIA labels and roles throughout the application
- Implemented keyboard navigation for tag interactions (Enter/Space keys)
- Added semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Included alt text for images and screen reader support

### ⚡ **Performance Improvements**
- Added debounced search (300ms delay) to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Used `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented proper dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks
- Added disabled state for search button when input is empty

### 🎯 **Enhanced TypeScript Implementation**
- Created comprehensive type definitions for all component props
- Added proper return type annotations (`JSX.Element`)
- Moved from inline types to dedicated interface files
- Improved type safety across the entire application

### 🔧 **Better State Management**
- Created custom `useSearchState` hook to centralize search logic
- Proper state synchronization between parent and child components
- Added search value clearing functionality for future use

### 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements**
- Added hover effects and smooth transitions for interactive elements
- Improved focus states with visible focus rings
- Better button states (disabled when no input)
- Enhanced visual feedback for user interactions

### 📁 **Code Organization**
- Extracted constants to a dedicated file for better maintainability
- Added barrel exports (`index.ts`) for cleaner imports
- Consistent file naming and folder structure
- Separated concerns: UI components, business logic, and configuration

## Why These Changes Matter

**For the team:** The code is now easier to understand, test, and modify. New developers can quickly find what they need.

**For users:** Better accessibility means the app works for everyone, and performance improvements make it feel more responsive.

**For maintenance:** Each piece has a clear purpose, making bug fixes and new features much simpler to implement.
